Case Study 18 :- Real-Time Log Processing
● Concepts Used: AWS Lambda, CloudWatch, S3.
● Problem Statement: "Set up a Lambda function that triggers whenever a new log entry
is added to a CloudWatch Log Group. The Lambda function should filter specific log
events and store them in an S3 bucket."
● Tasks:
○ Create a CloudWatch Log Group and set up a Lambda function that triggers on
new log entries.
○ Write a Python Lambda function to filter logs based on a keyword (e.g.,
'ERROR').
○ Store the filtered logs in an S3 bucket.
○ Test by generating logs and checking the S3 bucket for the filtered entries.
